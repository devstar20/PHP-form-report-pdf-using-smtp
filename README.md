# PHP form report pdf using smtp
This web application has been developed with PHP and Mysql database.
It used PHP SMTP mail testing tool(https://mailtrap.io/inboxes/1009730/messages) and mpdf for pdf generation.
Also for front-end development, I used bootstrap 4 and form validation js to check the validation of the fields.
